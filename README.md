<h1 align="center">Hey there! 🤘</h1>


<p align="justify">Computer Science student at <i>Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil</i> and Python programmer. I'm focusing my graduation onto Data Science and constantly getting up to date about Games, Music and Soccer, and also, I practice Jiu Jitsu!</p>
<p>I'm a Full Stack Javascript programmer by <strong>OneBitCode</strong>, which I'm really proud of, to have been their student, tho. It always feels good to learn something new.</p>
