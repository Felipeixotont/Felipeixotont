<p align="center">## Hey there! ðŸ¤˜</p>


<p align="center">Computer Science student at *Fluminense Federal University* and Python programmer, I'm focusing my graduation onto Data Science and constantly getting up to date about Games, Music and Soccer.
Also, I'm finishing *"Full Stack Javascript Programmer in 8 Weeks (with React + NodeJS)"* course at **OneBitCode**, it always feels good to learn something new.</p>
